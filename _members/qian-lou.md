Qian Lou is the director of the Unbounded AI Lab at the University of Central Florida, where he is a tenure-track assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and a member of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Cluster. He brings both industry and academic experience, having earned his Ph.D. from Indiana University Bloomington and served as a senior research scientist at Samsung Research America. At UCF, he leads the Unbounded AI Lab with the mission of overcoming the bounds imposed by privacy, trust, and performance constraints on AI infrastructure and systems, enabling Confidential, Verifiable, and Efficient AI Computing at Scale. Developing effective approaches requires a confluence of disciplines: AI infrastructure, Secure computing, Efficient Intelligent Systems, etc:
