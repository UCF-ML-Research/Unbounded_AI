I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida, working as a graduate research assistant in the Unbounded AI Lab advised by Prof. Qian Lou. My broad research interests lie in developing efficient and scalable AI systems. Outside of research, I enjoy solving algorithmic problems and participating in programming competitions.
